To install your sysopctl command (Bash script) in the system and make it executable like a regular command, follow these steps:

1. Make the Script Executable
Ensure that your Bash script (sysopctl.sh) is executable. You can do this using the chmod command:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x sysopctl.sh
This command grants execute permissions to the script.

2. Move the Script to a Directory in Your $PATH
The system looks for executable files in directories listed in the $PATH environment variable (e.g., /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, /bin). To make your script available as a system-wide command, move it to one of these directories. Typically, /usr/local/bin is used for custom scripts.

Move the script to /usr/local/bin (you may need sudo for permission):

bash
Copy code
sudo mv sysopctl.sh /usr/local/bin/sysopctl
Rename the script to sysopctl to remove the .sh extension so it behaves like a normal command.
3. Verify the Installation
To verify that your command is now available system-wide, run:

bash
Copy code
sysopctl --help
If everything is set up correctly, you should see the help message you defined in your script.

4. (Optional) Add the Command to Your Own Custom Directory
If you donâ€™t want to install the script system-wide, you can create your own directory for custom commands and add it to your $PATH.

Steps:
Create a directory (e.g., ~/bin):

bash
Copy code
mkdir -p ~/bin
Move the script there:

bash
Copy code
mv sysopctl.sh ~/bin/sysopctl
Add this directory to your $PATH (add this line to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile):

bash
Copy code
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
Apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.bashrc
Now, you can use sysopctl as a command from any location, without needing to specify the full path.

5. Update the Manual Page (Optional)
If you want to install a manual page for sysopctl:

Create a man page file, e.g., /usr/local/share/man/man1/sysopctl.1.

Add the content to the man page:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /usr/local/share/man/man1/sysopctl.1
Add content like:

sql
Copy code
.TH sysopctl 1 "October 2024" "v0.1.0" "System Management Tool"
.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
